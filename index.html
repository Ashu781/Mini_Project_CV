        <h2>About Me :</h2>
        <p>I am a 23 years old male coming from the Betul district situated in Madhya Pradesh, India.
            My family has a business of Iron trading, but as I am not interested in that field, I have done my studies in computer science engineering.
            Hoping that it would settle my life and give lots of money. Not knowing, there will be lots of competition and struggle.
            I am currently learning web development to give my career a boost along side my day to day job as a support engineer at NICE, Pune.
            I am an optimist and hope to get a very high paying salary as I grow in my career.
