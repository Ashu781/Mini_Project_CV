    <li><b>Guitar</b></li>
    <p>I like to play guitar. I have a gb&a guitar since my 9th standard. I am still learning to play guitar. I have learned basic chords like E, A, D, C, G, F. I know some basic strumming patterns and I am still in my learning phase.</p>
    <li><b>Table Tennis</b></li>
    <p>I enjoy playing table tennis. I started to play at my first working place. We used to play everyday and got pretty good at it. I am still leaning new ways to do a serve and return different serves.</p>
    <li><b>World History and Indian History</b></li>
    <p>I love knowing more about what happened in the past and how the things happened and the origin of all things.</p>
    <li><b>Music</b></li>
    <p>I spend a lot of time listening to music. I get into a different head space when I play my favourite songs and if I am drunk, then the vibe gets more exciting all together.</p>
